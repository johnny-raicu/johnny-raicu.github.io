						During my time at Glenbrook South High School, I have taken a rigurous college preparatory curriculum that
						includes Algebra 2, Precalculus, Advanced Placement (AP) Calculus, Biology,
						Chemistry, Physics, Computer Science, and Medical Technology.
						My favorite subjects are math and science, and I plan to pursue a premed undergraduate degree towards
						my ultimate goal to become a medical doctor.
					</p>
					<p>

						In pursuing extracurricular activities to learn more about medicine,
						I  joined the board of the <a href="https://med-gbs.github.io">Medical Chapter Club</a> at GBS where I was responsible
						for outreach and coordinating meetings that involved guest speakers from the medical
						field. I am the co-president of the GBS Medical Chapter for 2023 - 2024 where I lead the 
						a group of about 50 like-minded students to learn about the medical field. For more information, please

Chess is my favorite game to play in my downtime. I love the crazy gambits, endless calculation, and grueling endgames that make the game so dynamic and exciting!
At the age of 5, I learned the basics of the game and rapidly progressed playing everyday with my grandpa. By the age of 8, I participated in my
first chess tournament and won seventh place out of hundreds of players.
 I continued to play until middle school or age 11 when I finally became too busy
 with other activities to continue playing competitively, and therefore stepped away from chess for what would be almost 4 years.
 Fortunately, my love for the game was rekindled during the COVID-19 pandemic as the
 endless time during lockdown was the perfect opportunity to get back into the game.
 During my freshman year at Glenbrook South High School, I originally represented
 Board 6 of 8 but quickly surpassed my teammates within months to represent Board 4 of 8 at
 the state tournament where we took 4th place (in 2022) and 5th place (in 2023).
 (The board numbers are part of a ranking system to create fair matches where Board 1 from one school will play Board 1 from the other.)
 At the start of my freshman year, I created a LiChess account and found out that my blitz rating was a low 1200.
 Throughout the school year, my blitz rating grew to a high 1700, and in the summer going
 into my sophomore year started, my rating spiked to 2000.
Enjoy browsing through my LiChess study above where I showcase some of my favorite games!
